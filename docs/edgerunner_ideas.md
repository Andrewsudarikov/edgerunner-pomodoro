# Ideas for edgerunner-pomodoro

1. Add meetings to your work schedule, configure aletrs, the timer will display them both in the interface and as a popup.

1. Completely configurable environment (colors, font sizes, button placement, sounds, messages). Maybe should create a huge config file for that.

1. CLI version to run in a terminal. Fullscreen with visual countdown line and colored text, TMUX size, 40-character and 80-character mode for nerds.
	
	* Share timer settings between GUI and CLI versions

1. Refactor settings to use `YAML`
